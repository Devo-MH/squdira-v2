# Squdira Web3 Platform

## Overview

Squdira is a Web3 gaming platform that allows users to authenticate using their Ethereum wallet and securely interact with various Web3 games. The platform uses **JWT** and **refresh token** mechanisms for authentication, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for users.

### Key Features
- **Wallet-based Login**: Users log in using their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- **JWT Authentication**: Short-lived access tokens are generated for secure API access.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Refresh tokens allow users to maintain their session for up to 7 days without needing to re-login.
- **Protected Routes**: Access to certain routes is restricted and requires valid authentication.

## Frontend Overview

### Authentication Flow

1. Users log in by connecting their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
2. Upon successful login, the platform generates an access token (JWT) and a refresh token.
3. The access token is stored client-side and is used for authenticated API requests.
4. The refresh token is stored in an HTTP-only cookie and used to refresh the access token when it expires.

### Protected Routes

Certain routes, such as the user profile, are protected and require a valid JWT token. If the token is missing or expired, the user is redirected to the login page.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT for access tokens, refresh tokens for session persistence
- **Ethereum Wallet Integration**: MetaMask

## Development

### Running the Client and Server

To run both the client and server in development mode:

1. Start the **server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

2. Start the **client**:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

## Future Features

- **Tournament Integration**: Add the ability to create and join Web3 gaming tournaments.
- **Game Discovery**: Enhance the game discovery process by integrating more games and providing better search/filter options.
- **Marketplace**: Implement an in-game asset marketplace where users can trade NFTs and game-related assets.
- **Social Features**: Add social features such as friend lists, messaging, and player leaderboards.
